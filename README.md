# himinds-boosting-innovation-project-overview

The HiMinds boosting innovation project consists of several sub-projects. In each project, we explore different technologies and implement a product consisting of hardware, back-end and web app.

Most of our work is documented in our [tech blog](https://medium.com/himinds) at https://medium.com/himinds.

Currently, we have the following sub-projects:

* Open Source Wireless Environmental Sensor :white_circle:

## :white_circle: Open Source Wireless Environmental Sensor

### Project description:
The purpose of HiMinds wireless environmental sensor project is to develop a rechargeable battery-operated wireless sensor that can measure:
* Temperature with ±1.0°C accuracy
* Barometric pressure with 1 hPa absolute accuracy
* Humidity with ±3% accuracy

It will have a backend that collects the measurements and visualizes the measurements using Grafana.
